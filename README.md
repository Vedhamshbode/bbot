# Localization Technology Development and Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a self-localization and navigation system developed for a ground robot. The system leverages onboard sensors to enable autonomous navigation, utilizing advanced technologies and tools for robust performance.

## Project Description

- **System Development**: Created a system for self-localization and autonomous navigation using onboard sensors.
- **Technology Integration**: Employed Micro ROS and the Rosserial library to interface sensors with ESP32 and Arduino for low-level control.
- **Tools and Technologies**: 
  - ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
  - OpenCV
  - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
  - Navigation Algorithms

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Enables the robot to navigate independently using sensor data for localization.
- **Sensor Integration**: Interfaces with sensors through ESP32 and Arduino using Micro ROS and Rosserial.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilizes ROS2, OpenCV, and SLAM for efficient mapping and navigation.
